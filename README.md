# 2020_Presidential_Election_Benford_Analysis_UPDATED
NOTE: This is an updated repository of my "2020_Presidential_Election_Benford_Analysis." The reason for this update was to 1) refresh my R Programming skills and 2) clean up my amateur code from when I was still a university student. Below is the original README.md file from that repository: 

This is a deep statistical data analysis of the 2020 Presidential Race with the aim of detecting for ballot fraud or manipulation. Analysis was conducted at the state and county level with Washoe County of Nevada as the point of reference. Benford's Law analysis using R and SQL was conducted at each level to detect for ballot fraud and manipulation.

In this respository you will find the research paper I submitted to my university detailing my analysis, method of analysis, charts, conclusions, and papers referenced. The R Code is also pasted at the bottom of the research paper. The .csv files detailing the election results are also attached. Please feel free to message me if you are curious about the results or would like to do follow up research.
